Every year, about 7,000,000 people die from pollutants in our air. Governments around the globe have not taken initiative to tighten our lax economic policies, under the name of "helping the economy". Companies in the air quality monitoring industry are overpricing their products in $200 price range. In an effort to resolve this discrepancy, my colleagues and I sought to create a monitor that would perform at the SAME level (PM 2.5) as our competitors for 1/3 of the price.
